**[AribaWeb](http://aribaweb.org) is the Open Source component-based web application development framework for creating rich, AJAX-enabled applications with the absolute minimum of code (and no hand-coded Javascript)..**

# Auto AJAX #
  * In AribaWeb, you program with a singe simple, declarative, server-side programming model, and AribaWeb automatically provides AJAX behavior (incremental page refresh, drag & drop, auto-complete choosers, ...).

# Instant App #
  * Given only a set of UI-agnostic Java or Groovy domain classes, AribaWeb can apply rules to the available meta-data and instantly derive a fully functional application, all without a single line of application UI code.

# Live Edit & X-Ray #
  * Developers use X-Ray to "see through" running application UIs, getting visibility to the active hierarchy of components behind the scenes
  * With Live Edit, developers can use drag and drop to alter the UI layout and property sheets to tweak rules right in the browser. All changes take immediate effect in the live application.

# Proven Full Stack #
  * The AribaWeb distribution provides a full stack for the development of database-based business applications, including a deep library of Rich Widgets (forms, pivot tables, charts, rich text editors, etc.) as well as bindings to a bundled Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) database framework, and supports deployment in a variety of J2EE environments
  * AribaWeb is Enterprise Proven technology. Now in its fifth major release, AW has been included by Ariba as a critical component of its market-leading Spend Management solutions and Network Services for nearly a decade. AribaWeb is used daily by millions of users at more than a thousand of the world's largest enterprises, and has been part of over one trillion dollars of business-to-business electronic commerce.
